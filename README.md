# Metabolism Hackathon Repo


Trying something a little wild: The goal here is to create a starter kit in 🏗 scaffold-eth over the _next couple days_. It will have to be a fast a raw build. 

But the goal is to create something that any curator can fork. It should allow them to easily curate certain items that are on-sale on Zora, let them display them, and let them earn the finders fee. @maxbochman is here from Zora to help and plenty of BuidlGuidl members can support. Are you the builder to make this happen, anon? (Post updates here with progress!)

Here’s an app Tranqui built a while back that somewhat serves this purpose https://findersfeefinder.xyz (repo https://github.com/0xTranqui/Finders-Fee-Finder) 

Here’s a link to a full zora starter kit Tranqui released yesterday that provides bunch of example implementations of the whole zora toolkit. Of most interest to this project is prob the protocol page that provides every contract interaction as its own component so is super easy to fork (app: https://zora-starter-kit.vercel.app/protocol + repo: https://github.com/0xTranqui/zora-starter-kit)

seeing if we can’t figure out something cool + useable ahead of a hackathon we will be hosting starting August 4th — ik it’s not a lot of time so had to come to where the pros live

All the docs live here https://docs.zora.co

If u want to play around with our api (free to use dont need a key for under 30 requests/min) heres a nice GUI for it https://playground.api.zora.co/

currently our indexer is only watching the v3 asks module (buy now functionality), so unfortunately you wont be able to surface finders fee listed on the Offers + Auctions modules but v3 asks is the one with the most usage atm so still a good selection of content to work with if u want to play around with our api (free to use dont need a key for under 30 requests/min) heres a nice GUI for it

# 🏗 Scaffold-ETH

> everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node (v16 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contracts, `YourContract.sol` or `YourVyperContract.vy` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

# 💌 P.S.

🌍 You need an RPC key for testnets and production deployments, create an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and replace the value of `ALCHEMY_KEY = xxx` in `packages/react-app/src/constants.js` with your new key.

📣 Make sure you update the `InfuraID` before you go to production. Huge thanks to [Infura](https://infura.io/) for our special account that fields 7m req/day!
